				<p>Description of ReCiPe 2016 v1.1 (Hierarchic) impact categories used in this study as
					follows.</p><br>
				<h6><b>1.1. Global warming</b></h6>
				<p>Global warming (or climate change) is a measure for the adverse environmental effect
					caused by man-made emissions of greenhouse gases that cause heat to be trapped in the
					atmosphere and so result in a temperature rise of the Earth’s surface. The
					Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a characterization
					model to quantify the climate change impact of emissions released to the atmosphere.
					Emissions of different gases are given characterization factors, expressing the release of a
					gas in terms of its carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), depending upon its radiating force in
					relation to that of CO2.<br><br>
					On calculating CO2 equivalents, the residence time of the gases in the troposphere is taken
					into account and models for time periods of 20, 50 and 100 years have been developed.
					Commonly, a time horizon of 100 years is used, as this better reflects the long-term impacts
					of climate change. A 100-year time horizon is used in ReCiPe and therefore used for this
					project.<br><br>
					In ReCiPe, and for the purposes of this study, the substances contributing to climate
					change and their corresponding characterization factors (also known as Global Warming
					Potential, GWP) were based on IPCC 2013 data. The contribution to climate change was
					calculated by summing the products of the amount of each emitted harmful material (mi)
					and the corresponding characterization factor (GWPi) as expressed in the following
					equation:
				</p>
					<br>
					<p class="slds-text-align_center">Climate change = Σ(mi x GWPi)</p>
					<br>
				<p>	
					The ReCiPe mid-point category indicator for climate chance is kg CO2e for both ecosystem
					damage and for human health. The ReCiPe end-point category indicator for climate change
					is species lose per year for ecosystem damage and DALY for human health.<br><br>

					In regard to the treatment of biogenic versus fossil carbon, both emissions and removals of
					carbon within the system boundary are considered, which allows the net emissions of
					carbon from fossil and biogenic carbon to be differentiated. Removals of biogenic carbon
					were calculated using the carbon content (based on atomic/molecular mass) of the biogenic
					part of relevant finished products.<br><br>
					During the end-of-life stage, this stored carbon may be released again when biogenic
					carbon containing materials break down in landfill or is incinerated and these emissions of
					both CO2 and methane are accounted for. Therefore, removals of CO2 during growing
					equal the emissions of CO2 during incineration and the net environmental impact are zero.
					Biogenic carbon not released from cardboard and timber over the 100-year period of
					assessment was treated as stored.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.2. Ozone formation</b></h6>
				<p>Ozone formation (or photochemical oxidants formation, or smog) is a product of reactions
					that take place between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of
					UV radiation. Low-level O3 is a key photochemical oxidant of concern as it is toxic to
					humans.<br><br>
					Ozone formation is a measure of the adverse effects from the formation of low-level ozone
					and other photo-oxidants. Models are used to calculate photochemical oxidation, and they
					are based on the mass of each released substance and the photochemical ozone creation
					potential (POCP) of the substance. This is a measure of how likely it is that the substance
					will contribute towards smog formation and are calculated from the change in ozone
					concentration in a set volume of air with the introduction of the emission of a substance
					relative to the change in emission of ethylene.<br><br>
					The mid-point category indicator used for photochemical oxidation in ReCiPe is kilograms
					of nitrogen oxides equivalents (kg NOxe). The ReCiPe end-point category indicator is
					species lose per year for ecosystem damage and DALY for human health.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.3. Fine particulate matter formation</b></h6>
				<p>Particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm are referred to as PM2.5 and
					represents a complex mixture of organic and inorganic substances, of which the organic
					fraction is especially complex, containing hundreds of organic compounds.<br><br>
					Primary particles are emitted directly from sources. Secondary particles are formed from
					chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving atmospheric oxygen (O2) and water vapour
					(H2O); reactive species such as ozone (O3); radicals such as the hydroxyl (dOH) and
					nitrate (dNO3) radicals; and pollutants [such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides
					(NOx), and organic gases] from natural and anthropogenic sources.<br><br>
					Particulate matter can be anthropogenic or natural and can adversely affect human health
					(e.g. causing respiratory illnesses such as asthma) and also have impacts on climate and
					precipitation. The size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health
					problems. Once inhaled, the smallest particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause
					serious health effects.<br><br>

					Particle impacts are reported as an expression of the potential contribution to particulates in
					the atmosphere that are taken up by humans. In ReCiPe, this is reported in kilograms of
					PM2.5 equivalents (kg PM2.5 eq) formed and taken up by humans. The ReCiPe end-point
					category indicator for particulate matter formation is DALY.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.4. Terrestrial acidification</b></h6>
				<p>Terrestrial acidification refers to processes that increase the hydrogen ion concentration
					([H+]) and soil systems, such as atmospheric deposition of sulfur, nitrogen and
					phosphorous compounds. Any change from the natural pH can have detrimental effects on
					plant and aquatic life.<br><br>
					Some common emissions that contribute to acidification potential include nitrogen oxides
					(NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH4).
					The ReCiPe method calculates characterisation factors for emissions that contribute to
					acidification of soil relative to the acidification potential of SO2. This is based upon a
					European geography over a 100 year time horizon. The ReCiPe end-point category
					indicator for terrestrial acidification is species lose per year.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.5. Freshwater eutrophication</b></h6>
				<p>Freshwater eutrophication is defined as nutrient enrichment (which can result in algae
					growth) in a freshwater aquatic environment, resulting in increased consumption and hence
					depletion of oxygen from the environment. This nutrient pollution is typically generated in
					aquatic environments from phosphorous or nitrogen compounds through discharges from
					sewage treatment works, decaying plant life in pulp and paper mills and storm water run-off
					of fertilizers or manure.<br><br>
					Typically, in freshwater ecosystems in Europe, phosphorus compounds are the limiting
					factor in eutrophication of an environment. As a result, using the ReCiPe method,
					freshwater eutrophication-inducing substances are expressed in equivalents of kilograms of
					phosphate (kg Pe) for freshwater ecosystems at the mid-point. The ReCiPe end-point
					category indicator for freshwater eutrophication is species lose per year.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.6. Land use change</b></h6>
				<p>Land use change refers to the transformation of land into a different use type for agricultural
					purposes such as growing crops or trees or due to urbanisation (construction of roads or
					buildings). When the use of an area of land has change, the number of species will differ
					from that in a reference land use (i.e. natural conditions). The relationship between the nu
					used for agricultural/urban purposes is key is determination the species loss (or gain) from
					land use change. In ReCiPe a species-area relationship formula from McArthur and Wilson
					(1967) is used to calculate the number of plant species in an area:
				</p>
					<br>
					<p class="slds-text-align_center">S = cAz</p>
					<br>
				<p>
					where S is the number of plant species, A is the size of the area (m2), c is the species
					richness factor and z are the species accumulation factor.<br><br>

					The ReCiPe mid-point and end-point category indicators for land use change is square
					metres of crop land per year equivalents (m2a crop e) and species lose per year,
					respectively.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.7. Mineral resource scarcity</b></h6>
				<p>Mineral resource scarcity considers the metal resources extracted through mining
					operations. The reference unit for this category considers the additional costs that society
					has to pay as a result of the extraction of a mineral and is calculated by multiplying the
					marginal cost increase of a resource by the amount that is extracted through mining over a
					set time period (i.e. allocated to the product under investigation). Everything is then
					compared to the cost impact of iron, resulting in a mid-point category indicator of kilograms
					of copper equivalents (kg Cue). The ReCiPe end-point category indicator is USD.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.8. Fossil resource scarcity</b></h6>
				<p>Fossil resource scarcity is a measure of the impact from consuming non-renewable natural
					fossil resources. The consumption of resources that take thousands of years to be
					regenerated limits the options of future generations and can result in more expensive
					and/or damaging exploration and extraction of poorer quality, less-available reserves. The
					reference unit for fossil resource scarcity was calculated by considering the energy content
					per kilogram of each hydrocarbon type and dividing this by energy content per kilogram of
					crude oil.<br><br>
					The result is a fossil resource scarcity impact for each oil, coal and gas type as kilograms of
					crude oil equivalents (this is the mid-point indicator). The ReCiPe end-point category
					indicator is USD.</p><br>

				<h6><b>1.9. Water consumption</b></h6>
				<p>Water consumption measures the extraction and discharge of freshwater from
					watercourses. The ReCiPe mid-point category indicator is m3 of water. End-point category
					indicators for ecosystem and human health are and species lose per year and DALY,
					respectively.</p><br>
